## üöÄ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter:

FaceRecog_Using_ResNet18.ipynb

2. Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset:

```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

3. Update the dataset path inside the notebook:

```
data_path = 'drive/MyDrive/FaceRecognition/Dataset'
```

4. Run all cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess images
   - Train the ResNet18 model
   - Evaluate performance on the test set
